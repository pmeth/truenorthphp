                    Microsoft Azure is open, flexible and a scalable platform which is a great choice for app creation. Azure supports virtual machines on several Linux flavors such as CentOS, Ubuntu, Suse. Not only does it support open platforms but also open development tools. Support for the various development tools is pretty exhaustive. For example, look into what we have in store for Azure and PHP at the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/php/" target="_blank">PHP Development Centre</a>, a rich resource for tutorials and documentation, which will enable you to get started with development on the cloud. Also look into the support for <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6eb51f05-ef01-4513-ac83-4c5f50c95fb5" target="_blank">PHP tools for Visual Studio</a>, which provides a well known editor for PHP, HTML/JAVA/CSS support and most importantly integration with Azure itself.<br>

<a href="http://www.delvia.com">Delvia</a> started when several senior developers got to talking about our observations of the software development industry. We agreed that companies universally have issues hiring and keeping the right people. We also agreed that developers employed by large companies can have a tendency to not keep their skills up to date and thus have a difficult time adapting to a rapidly changing development landscape.<br>
<br>
As a result of this conversation we concluded that we should join together. Using our vast experience we could provide a better alternative and offer it to businesses of all sizes. We made a resolution to acquire the best talent, use the best tools and provide the necessary training to stay on top of the industry.<br>
<br>
Delvia is proud to support and serve the PHP community. We are interested in forming lasting relationships with developers of PHP and other fine languages.
