Nowhere in web development is that more true than e-commerce, where it\'s remarkably easy to do something you shouldn\'t, like create a form that submits credit cards over http that then get sent by unencrypted email (with the card security code, if you really want to throw caution and compliance to the wind :)</p><p>In this talk we\'ll explore the land mines that aren\'t really "development" but that developers <em>need</em> to at least a familiarity with: PCI compliance (and common misconceptions) and ways to avoid it; tax rate madness; shipping and how much it makes me want to cry; credit card processing and interchange; alternate payment methods; advanced analytics; and whatever else you have questions about.</p>',
