accoustic coupler modem, connecting to an HP-2000 mini-computer to program in interpretted BASIC. 
30-something years later (ahem), he is still coding away, but now embraces open source

Alfred enjoys sharing knowledge and ideas with peers, which explains his life-long involvement in user groups, and his regular, if infrequent, blog posts at http://notoriouswebmaster.com.',
