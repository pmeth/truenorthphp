This means that a distributed system has to be built to accommodate high availability and high traffic requirements. 
This talk will touch on scaling a simple PHP application residing in a LAMP environment (a stand-alone server is a common setup) to a scaled solution having redundant load balancers, distributed web and database servers. Most common problems (with both, scaling the system as well as scaling the PHP application) will be covered with fully defined solutions, hints and tricks (learned the hard way), as well as best practices. Real world examples will also be given to grasp the perspective of how big guys (Facebook, Flickr, Wikipedia to name a few) handled certain scenarios and overcame major obstacles. ',
