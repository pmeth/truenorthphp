In this tutorial, we’ll spend some time going over basic Docker concepts like Dockerfiles, containers, images and registries. Then we’ll look at some sample applications including Wordpress, Drupal and some framework-based examples and talk about strategies for building Docker images for these various different scenarios.

The Kanban method for managing software projects lowers the barrier to shipping working code and dramatically reduces the project management overhead for engineers participating in the process. In short, Kanban allows engineers and product groups to deliver real value at a very rapid pace, while still maintaining some sanity. Kanban is an excellent complement to the technical aspects of a continuous delivery process. We\'ll learn what Kanban means to your team, how to get started transitioning to it, and how to avoid common mistakes.'
